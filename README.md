DynForm
=======

Application development often involves creating dialogs where the user is presented a form to enter or edit some sort of data. DynForm aims to make development of this a little bit easier. By implementing a simple interface into your data entities, the DynForm library will be able to semi-automatically build a form and display it to the user to fill in.
